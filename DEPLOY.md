# Deployment Guide: AK74 TODO.md Kanban Task Board

This guide explains how to package and deploy this VS Code extension to multiple machines.

## 1. Package the Extension (.vsix)

To create a distributable package, follow these steps on your development machine:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```powershell
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Package the extension:**
    Using `vsce` (VS Code Extension Manager), run the following command to generate a `.vsix` file:
    ```powershell
    npx @vscode/vsce package --no-yarn
    ```
    *Note: The `--no-yarn` flag ensures `npm` is used for the build process.*

3.  **Result:**
    A file named `ak74-todo-kanban-0.4.3.vsix` (or similar, depending on the version in `package.json`) will be created in the root directory.
